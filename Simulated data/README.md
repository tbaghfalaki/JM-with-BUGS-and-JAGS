Here, we will examine two distinct simulated datasets. The first one is based on a constant value for the baseline hazard, so the inverse of the cumulative hazard function is a common method for this purpose. The R code can be found in "simulated_JM1.R", and the simulated data can be found in "long.data_1.RData" and "surv.data_1.RData".
The longitudinal profiles and KM plot are presented [here](/sim.md). 
The second one is based on the permutational algorithm using the PermAlgo package. The R code for this method can be found in "simulated_JM2.R", and the simulated data can be found in "long.data_2.RData" and "surv.data_2.RData". 
The longitudinal profiles and KM plot are presented [here](/sim.md).
