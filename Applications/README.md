This file contains the R codes for all applications discussed in the paper, covering various joint modeling scenarios including:

* Joint modeling of multi-marker data and survival time,
* Joint modeling of multi-marker data and competing risks,
* Joint modeling of zero-inflated longitudinal outcome and survival time,
* Joint modeling of longitudinal outcome and survival time with a cure fraction.
