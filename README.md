## Joint modeling of longitudinal and time to event with BUGS
BUGS syntax using R2OpenBUGS or R2jags is  an attractive and flexible tool for joint modeling of longitudinal markers and survival time. Here, we have discussed "Joint modeling of longitudinal and time to event with BUGS", which includes different types of longitudinal markers or multiple longitudinal markers as longitudinal sub-models and a Cox model with different forms of baseline hazard or an accelerated failure time model for the survival sub-model. In addition to these, a competing risk model is also discussed. Also, different forms of association between two sub-models have been explained. The paper of this work, entitled "Joint modeling of longitudinal and time to event with BUGS", has been submitted by Taban Baghfalaki, Mojtaba Ganjali, Antoine Barbieri, Reza Hashemi and Helene Jacqmin-Gadda.
